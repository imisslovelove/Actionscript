ActionScript 4 Language Reference, Virtual Machine Specification and
White Paper

Adobe and ActionScript are either registered trademarks or trademarks

Adobe is publishing the ActionScript 4 specifications in the hope that
they may be useful to the programming language and managed runtime
communities.  The specifications are as they existed when the project
with which they were associated was discontinued and therefore may be
considered incomplete.  Source code for the compiler and runtime is
not available.  Adobe has no plans to resume development of
ActionScript 4.

Specification draft, which is a text file, is licensed under the
